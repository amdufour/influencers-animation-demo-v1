						<h2>So how do we produce Essentials Newsletters using AI?</h2>
						<div class="description">There is great content out there, but finding it is an ever greater challenge. Fake news, conspiracy theories and info bubbles mean that getting the information and news you need takes up valuable time we know you would prefer to use on better things. So we’ve done the hard stuff for you.</div>

						<h2>Never again miss anything, or anyone, that matters.</h2>
						<div class="description">Essentials AI algorithms highlight only trusted content from a diverse set of vetted industry experts. We like to think about what we do as orchestrating great (and often hidden) content from social media. No bias, blah blah or BS. In fact, we value transparency and accreditation so highly, you will always see the original post from the author.</div>

						<h2>How we get to the experts behind the experts.</h2>
						<div class="description">Our AI tool has had plenty of time to learn what makes a great thought leader. By monitoring social media 24/7 it automatically highlights the most trusted industry experts, not the loudest. It also focuses on finding where the thought leaders get their news from, what they read, share, and who they are connected to. The best of this expanded network are then included in our set of experts.</div>

						<h2>Voila, your Essentials Newsletter is ready for reading.</h2>
						<div class="description">Now that we have compiled the very best experts to follow, we filter all their content. Only the top scoring articles by relevance make it into the final newsletter. So, all content you read has been filtered through a diverse and relevant set of trusted experts before we send it out. This means you will never see the experts’ holiday pics in our newsletter.</div>
